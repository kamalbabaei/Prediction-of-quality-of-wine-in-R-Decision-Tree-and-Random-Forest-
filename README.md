# Prediction-of-quality-of-wine-in-R-Decision-Tree-and-Random-Forest
In this project, I have used Decision Tree and Random Forest in order to predict the quality of wine using red wine data set.
This datasets is related to red variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. The datasets can be viewed as classification or regression tasks. The classes are ordered and not balanced (e.g. there are much more normal wines than excellent or poor ones). This dataset is also available from the UCI machine learning repository
